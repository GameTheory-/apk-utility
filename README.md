![image](tools/menu.png)

APK Utility is for decompiling, compiling, zipaligning, and signing apk and jar files. The utility also has the ability to tag your frameworks. This is a very good feature if you want to install frameworks for multiple different devices without having to remove one for the other.

**This project uses:**
- [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/)

## Usage
Tested on ubuntu & xubuntu
For 64 bit systems only

1. Make sure to have java installed.
2. Make sure the "apku" file has execute permissions.
3. Place all your apk and jar files in the input folder. If zipaligning only, place them in the zipalign folder.
4. Execute the file as follows in a terminal: `./apku`
5. optional - Use the "Add Desktop Shortcut" option for quick access.
